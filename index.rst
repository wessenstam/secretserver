You will need to initiate a remote desktop connection to the **PUBLIC IP** address of the Win machine. This IP address is dynamic and will change whenever the lab environment is restarted. The Win server machine serves as a jump box from which you can then RDP to the other windows machines by hostname. Lab Exercise 1 explains the process of identifying the IP address of your lab jump box and connecting to it.
